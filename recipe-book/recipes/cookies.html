      <h1>Steps:</h1>
      <div id="recipe-steps">
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat Your Oven:
               The journey begins by preheating your oven to 350°F (180°C). Line your baking sheets with parchment paper, a canvas that ensures easy cookie removal and minimal cleanup, setting the stage for cookie perfection.
            </li>
            <li>A Ballet of Dry Ingredients:
               In a medium-sized bowl, create a symphony by whisking together the all-purpose flour and baking soda. This delicate choreography ensures the even distribution of dry ingredients, promising cookies with the perfect texture.
            </li>
            <li>The Buttery Prelude:
               In a separate, grand mixing bowl, begin with the unsalted butter at room temperature—the maestro of this composition. Add the granulated sugar, light-brown sugar, and a pinch of salt, and commence the melodious beating. As you go, the mixture will transform into a creamy, light confection, setting the tone for the cookie's soft and chewy texture.
            </li>
            <li>The Vanilla Sonata:
               Introduce the pure vanilla extract like a melodious sonata. Follow this with the eggs, one at a time, each adding its own unique note to the ensemble. Mix until the composition reaches a harmonious crescendo, producing a smooth, well-combined dough.
            </li>
            <li>Chocolate Chip Symphony:
               Now, it's time for the pièce de résistance. Gently fold in the semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips into the cookie dough. These nuggets of chocolatey delight are the virtuoso performers, creating enchanting bursts of sweetness with every bite.
            </li>
            <li>Cookie Artistry:
               Using a cookie scoop or a spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared parchment-lined baking sheets, allowing ample space for the cookies to expand and breathe. Into the oven they go, for a magical 10-12 minutes, just enough to achieve that golden halo around the edges while retaining their soft, inviting core.
            </li>
            <li>The Grand Finale:
               As you pull the cookies out of the oven, let their heavenly aroma envelop your senses. Allow them to cool briefly on the baking sheets before transferring them to a wire rack for their grand finale—a moment of perfect rest.
            </li>
