         <h1>Steps:</h1>
         <div id="recipe-steps">
            <p>
            <ol>
               <p>
               <li>Prepare the Crust:
                  Begin by preheating your oven to 325°F (160°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and melted butter. Press this mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, creating a firm and even crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then set it aside to cool.
               </li>
               <p>
               <li>Create the Cheesecake Base:
                  In a large mixing bowl, unleash your imagination as you blend the room-temperature cream cheese and granulated sugar. Add the eggs one by one, allowing each to be fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the pure vanilla extract, sour cream, and heavy cream until the mixture is smooth and silky, like the canvas for your dessert masterpiece.
               </li>
               <p>
               <li>Assemble the Crazy Layers:
                  It's time to go wild! Pour half of the cheesecake filling onto the cooled crust. Now, let your creativity shine by adding a layer of mixed berries, a sprinkling of chocolate chips, and a whimsical scattering of crushed pretzels. Pour the remaining cheesecake filling over these delightful surprises.
               </li>
               <p>
               <li>Bake and Marvel:
                  Bake your creation in the oven for approximately 60-70 minutes, or until the edges are set, and the center still has a slight jiggle, like the finale of a perfectly choreographed dance. Turn off the oven, crack the oven door, and allow the cheesecake to cool inside for an hour.
               </li>
               <p>
               <li>Decorate with Abandon:
                  Once your cheesecake has cooled to room temperature, let your artistic spirit soar. Drizzle it with luscious caramel sauce and artfully dollop whipped cream. For a touch of whimsy, add edible flowers, creating a dessert tableau that is as beautiful as it is delicious.
               </li>
               <p>
               <li>Chill and Serve:
                  Place your whimsical creation in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or, ideally, overnight. This will allow the flavors to meld and the cheesecake to set, ready to dazzle your taste buds.
