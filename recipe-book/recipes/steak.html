      <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>2 thick-cut ribeye steaks (about 1.5 inches thick)</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
         <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
         <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
         <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Steps:</h1>
      <div id="recipe-steps">
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat the Grill:
               Start by preheating your grill to high heat. Make sure the grates are clean and well-oiled to prevent sticking.
            </li>
            <li>Season the Steaks:
               Brush both sides of the ribeye steaks with olive oil and generously season them with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Allow the steaks to sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to take the chill off, ensuring even cooking.
            </li>
            <li>Grill to Perfection:
               Place the seasoned steaks on the hot grill. For medium-rare, grill each side for approximately 4-5 minutes. Adjust the cooking time to your preferred level of doneness. Use a meat thermometer to achieve the desired internal temperature (125°F for medium-rare, 135°F for medium).
            </li>
            <li>Rest the Steaks:
               Once cooked to your liking, remove the steaks from the grill and let them rest for about 5 minutes on a cutting board. This allows the juices to redistribute and keeps the meat juicy and tender.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the Garlic Butter Sauce:
               While the steaks are resting, heat a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Stir in the unsalted butter and cook until it melts and turns a light golden brown. Add the chopped parsley, thyme leaves (if using), and red pepper flakes (if you like a little heat). Stir well and remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>Slice and Serve:
               Slice the rested ribeye steaks against the grain into 1/2-inch thick slices. Drizzle the luscious garlic butter sauce over the steak slices, allowing it to melt and infuse every bite with rich, savory flavor.
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy the Feast:
               Plate your Grilled Ribeye Steak with Garlic Butter Sauce alongside your favorite side dishes, such as creamy mashed potatoes or grilled asparagus. Each bite will be a symphony of juicy, perfectly cooked steak and the irresistible, buttery garlic sauce.
            </li>
